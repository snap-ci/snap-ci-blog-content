#### When did you join Snap?

I joined Snap in January 2014. I started right after I graduated college in Brazil. Now that I'm with Snap, I basically do everything that Badri (the Product Manager) doesn't.

#### So what's an average day look like for you?

I'm always working on something. Most of the time it goes well, but something might happen: for example, a customer or trial user has a problem. We found a bug. Heroku goes down. So we get interrupted. That's actually an average day!

#### What do you like about Snap?

I was able to set up the entire dev environment on a Monday in 30 minutes. Everything was ready, automated, the scripts and the deployment pipelines. Everything.

#### Where would you like to see Snap go?

I want Snap to be a well-known, reliable service for people who don't have time to get their hands dirty to achieve Continuous Delivery. I want to welcome new users who are learning about automatic tests and continuous integration: Snap can be the playground for them to learn more about Continuous Delivery.

#### What's your favorite part of your workday?

I really enjoy getting feedback from clients. It's nice when the client is very happy, and then two weeks later they're buying it. It's very rewarding.
